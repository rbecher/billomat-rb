h1. billomat-rb

A neat ruby library for interacting with the "RESTful API":http://www.billomat.com/api/ of "billomat":http://www.billomat.com/.

h2. Warning

This is work in progress (and has been for quite some time).
Feedback and patches are welcome, though :)

h2. Requirements

billomat-rb requires active_resource and active_support in version 2.3.2 or above.

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
